When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two common scenarios: 

1 - To show off your work for employers etc.
2 - Open source/collabrative projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Boils down to control.  You don't want a remote changing you files without you know what is going on... otherwise it would be an excellent way to 
produce a multitude of bugs!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you sue one instead of theanother?

Fork - take a whole reposetory, and make a copy of it, under your own control.
Clone - Copying a repository from a remote location. This copy is meant to be syncronized with the remote repository. This allows collaboration etc.
Branch - A string of changes inside of the repository, representing a set of experimental changes for example.

Fork is used to take over/ or experiment with some one else's repository.
Clone is commonly used - it is rarely desired to have work done on the same computer as the central repository. Github does have it's limitations.
Branching is used for a host of reasons, including experimental branches, trying out different directions etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Main benifit seems to be preplanning a messy merge. You can compare the two files, and plan on how you intent to resolve the issue, before committing.
Having the local file also has be benifit of no web connection required.
