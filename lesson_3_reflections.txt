When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two common scenarios: 

1 - To show off your work for employers etc.
2 - Open source/collabrative projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Boils down to control.  You don't want a remote changing you files without you know what is going on... otherwise it would be an excellent way to 
produce a multitude of bugs!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you sue one instead of theanother?

Fork - take a whole reposetory, and make a copy of it, under your own control.
Clone - Copying a repository from a remote location. This copy is meant to be syncronized with the remote repository. This allows collaboration etc.
Branch - A string of changes inside of the repository, representing a set of experimental changes for example.

Fork is used to take over/ or experiment with some one else's repository.
Clone is commonly used - it is rarely desired to have work done on the same computer as the central repository. Github does have it's limitations.
Branching is used for a host of reasons, including experimental branches, trying out different directions etc.
