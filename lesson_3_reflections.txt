When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Two common scenarios: 

1 - To show off your work for employers etc.
2 - Open source/collabrative projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Boils down to control.  You don't want a remote changing you files without you know what is going on... otherwise it would be an excellent way to 
produce a multitude of bugs!
