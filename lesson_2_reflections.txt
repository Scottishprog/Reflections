What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialzing a repository generates the empty metadata tracking files needed. Can't update a repository that does not exist... 
-------------------------------------------------

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is just that... a stageing area, free of all other thinges excpet what has not been commited yet. 

Repository is history, locked in place. 
Working directory is open, not locked at all. (Assuming no interfearing file permissions!)
